              CLOUDMAP:
CLOUDMAP is a research project using the combined effort of four colleges. The University of Oklahoma is working with students and professors from the School of Meteorology and with Aviation by flying UAVs to measure the boundary layer of the atmosphere in order to receive more detailed information of the boundary layer.
This effort focuses on the development and implementation of unmanned aircraft systems and their integration with sensors for atmospheric measurements on Earth with an emphasis on Meteorology and Atmospheric Physics (MAP). This includes platform and autonomous systems development, sensors and remote imaging for weather sensing, and operations in the NAS. While broad in scope, the topics are linked by common platforms and onboard systems to provide useful data related to a number of NSF goals. Enabling meteorological measurements to increase our understanding of Earth’s complex atmospheric dynamics serves as the key focus in this collaboration.

Jenny Handsley is a Meteorology student from the University of Reading in the UK, currently on an exchange year at the University of Oklahoma. She will return to the UK in June 2016 to complete a final year before graduating from Reading in 2017 with a master’s degree in Meteorology. As a qualified pilot, she is very interested to combine her fascination for both weather and aviation by getting involved with the CLOUDMAP research project. She is excited by the significance this project will have in determining the future of weather forecasting.

Erin Burns will graduate from the University of Oklahoma in the spring of 2017 with a bachelor’s degree in meteorology.  She got involved with the CLOUDMAP project because she can see UAVs becoming an important way to collect meteorological data in the future.  When she graduates, she plans on commissioning into the United States Air Force as a weather officer.

Miranda Morgan is a meteorology and mathematics double major at the University of Oklahoma. She is planning on graduation in Fall 2017. She got involved in CLOUDMAP because it studies the two things she is wanting to be involved with after graduation, aviation and meteorology. She plans to apply her math background into a meteorology job for an airport after she graduates. Something interesting about her is that she loves to read and spends most of her free time doing such.

Jasmine Montgomery is a meteorology major at the University of Oklahoma and counting down to graduation in May 2017. She got involved in CLOUDMAP because it was a research opportunity she couldn't turn down. She plans on attending graduate school so this research project will prepare her for what's ahead. An interesting fact about her, besides loving the weather, is that she is an accomplished violinist with over ten years of experience.
